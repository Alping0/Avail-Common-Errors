If you couldn't monitor your cpu usage and network traffic in grafana dashboard you should upgrade your grafana and prometheus to the latest versions:

```
sudo apt-get upgrade -y prometheus prometheus-node-exporter
sudo apt-get upgrade -y grafana
```

If you see connection refused error try:

```
sudo ufw allow 9944
```
If its not working your port could be used for another operation, to learn that:

```
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep avail
```

In the example above this node use 35549 to speak TCP in avail so you have to learn yourselves and change it with 9944, so new command should be like this: ##(Don't change anything if it works by default)##

```
cd avail
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}' http://localhost:35549
```
If you use docker you can run:

```
docker exec -it $(docker ps | grep -i availj | awk '{print $NF}') bash -c 'curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '\''{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}'\'' http://localhost:9944/'
```

If you saw same number while download your node looks like stuck don't worry, wait patiently sometimes it caused delay according to your vps providers network traffic. Don't exit, wait until complete.
